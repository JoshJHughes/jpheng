# README #

Jpheng is a personal project designed to (one day) become a working physics 
engine.  It is currently in the very early stages of development and is thus 
not suitable for use in any project.  I fully expect that all aspects of the 
code will be significantly altered, extended, and improved.  

### Requirements ###
Jpheng uses Pyglet and Numpy to handle graphics and numerical aspects of the 
code.  It is being written with Python 3.5.2.

### Installation ###
Jpheng is not set up to work with any automated installation tools.  If you 
wish to use Jpheng please download and unpack the source code and install the 
packages listed in "./requirements.txt" using pip.

### Using Jpheng ###
Executable scripts may be found under "./scripts"
